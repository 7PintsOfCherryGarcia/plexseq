For the above study four different libraries prepared of different individuals that are available in the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA). It can be accessed under the project number PRJEB39078(already demultiplexed)

After the initial demultiplexing based not the 96 unique barcodes that were used, the following index files were used for the final demultiplexing using Plexseq. 

More specifically:
For MiSeq 010 samples that were in A1-H6 positions at the plate the following indices were used:
CAGTCGAAT	TCACAGATG
TCAGTCGAA	TCACAGATG
CTCAGTCGA	TGCAGATGA

And for samples that were in A7-H12 positions at the plate the following indices were used:
CAGTCGAAT	CTCACAGAT
TCAGTCGAA	TGCAGATGA
CTCAGTCGA	TCACAGATG

For MiSeq 024 samples that were in A1-H6 positions at the plate the following indices were used:
CAGTCGAAT	TCACAGATG
TCAGTCGAA	TCACAGATG
CTCAGTCGA	TGCAGATGA

And for samples that were in A7-H12 positions at the plate the following indices were used:
CAGTCGAAT	CTCACAGAT
TCAGTCGAA	TGCAGATGA
CTCAGTCGA	TCACAGATG


For MiSeq 046 samples that were in A1-H6 positions at the plate the following indices were used:
CAGTCGAAT	ACTCACAGA
TCAGTCGAA	CTCACAGAT
CTCAGTCGA	TCACAGATG
ACTCAGTCG	TGCAGATGA
CAGTCGAAT	TCACAGATG
TCAGTCGAA	ACTCACAGA
CTCAGTCGA	ACTCACAGA
ACTCAGTCG	CTCACAGAT
CAGTCGAAT	CTCACAGAT
CTCAGTCGA	TGCAGATGA

And for samples that were in A7-H12 positions at the plate the following indices were used:
CAGTCGAAT	CTCACAGAT
TCAGTCGAA	TCACAGATG
CTCAGTCGA	TGCAGATGA
ACTCAGTCG	TCACAGATG
CAGTCGAAT	TGCAGATGA
TCAGTCGAA	TGCAGATGA
CTCAGTCGA	CTCACAGAT
ACTCAGTCG	ACTCACAGA
TCAGTCGAA	ACTCACAGA
ACTCAGTCG	TCACAGATG


For MiSeq 083 samples that were in A1-H6 positions at the plate the following indices were used:

CAGTCGAAT	TCACAGATG
TCAGTCGAA	ACTCACAGA
CTCAGTCGA	ACTCACAGA

And for samples that were in A7-H12 positions at the plate the following indices were used:
CAGTCGAAT	CTCACAGAT
TCAGTCGAA	TCACAGATG
CTCAGTCGA	TGCAGATGA
ACTCAGTCG	TCACAGATG
ACTCAGTCG	CTCACAGAT
TCAGTCGAA	TGCAGATGA
